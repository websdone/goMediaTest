# GoMediaTestTask

** This work is considered as 'Under development'

* To run project locally please use terminal http-server that will start in port http://localhost:8080
* To run SASS please use sass --watch css/main.scss/main.css
* I am not using Grunt or Gulp to compress and optimize space again due to lack of time and Angular framework runs from ajax.googleapis.com and not locally for the same reason, I just wanted to show I can do the task required
* I have used Angular Material for Light-box and Accordion
* For light-box with detailed info please ng-click on the title and run it from server
